# [INTEST - Enormous Input Test](https://www.spoj.com/problems/INTEST/)

The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the **enormous Input/Output** warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

## Input

The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k &#8804; 10&#8311;). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer t&#7522;, not greater than 10&#8313;, each.

## Output

Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers t&#7522; are divisible by k.

## Example

```
Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4
